# Spatiotemporal modeling tools for Python

This package provides tools for modeling and analyzing spatial and temporal
autocorrelation in Python.  It is based on the methods from the paper
[Functional brain networks reflect spatial and temporal
autocorrelation](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-023-01299-3).
Included are methods to compute the following statistics:

- Compute TA-Δ<sub>1</sub> (i.e. first-order temporal autocorrelation)
- Compute SA-λ and SA-∞ (i.e. measurements of spatial autocorrelation)
- Lin's concordance
- Fingerprinting performance, from [Finn et al (2015)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.4135)

It will also generate surrogate timeseries for the following:

- Spatiotemporal model from [Shinn et al (2023)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-023-01299-3)
- Noiseless spatiotemporal model from [Shinn et al (2023)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-023-01299-3)
- Zalesky matching model from [Zalesky et al (2012)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053811912001784)
- Eigensurrogate model from [Shinn et al (2023)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-023-01299-3)
- Phase scramble null model

## Contact

Please report bugs to <https://github.com/mwshinn/spatiotemporal/issues>.  This
includes any problems with the documentation.  Pull Requests for bugs are
greatly appreciated.

This package is actively maintained.  However, it is feature complete, so no new
features will not be added.  This is intended to be a supplement for the paper,
not a general purpose package for all aspects of spatiotemporal data analysis.
