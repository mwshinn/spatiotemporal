def fingerprint(subjects, values):
    """Fingerprinting performance, from [Finn et al (2015)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.4135).

    Note:
        This implementation is slightly different than that of Finn et al (2015).
        Here, instead of having separate databases, we use all other scans from all
        other subjects as the "database".  Then, we see if the match is from the
        same subject or different subjects.  This means that if there are more than
        two observations for each subject, there will be more than one "correct"
        best match.  However, it also means that there are many more possible
        incorrect matches for a given subject than there are in Finn et al (2015).

    Args:
      subjects (list or 1xN numpy array): a list of length N giving the subject ID.  N should be
          the total number of observations, e.g., if there are 10 subjects with 3
          scans each, N = 30.
      values (Nxk numpy array): numpy matrix, where N is as above and k is the size of
          the feature on which to perform the fingerprinting.  E.g., if we are
          fingerprinting based on TA-delta1 of each node in a 360 node atlas, k=360.

    Returns:
      float: The fraction of correct fingerprinting identifications
